# rayTracing3D

This work is inspired by "Concours Centrale-Sup√©lec 2021 - Informatique commune - MP,PC,PSI,TSI"

It is meant as a coding challenge, the calculus will be done in C and the image printing on the screen will be done in python (because of easier access to functions that will make images on screen).

In a first time, only spheres will be dealt with, but image fragmentation into triangles for universal treatment may be done in the future.
